1. Initialize Variables:

prefix_sum: To store the cumulative sum of stone values as we iterate through the list.

remainder_index_map: A dictionary to map each remainder (when prefix_sum is divided by 5) to its earliest index.

max_length: To keep track of the maximum length of the valid subsequence found.

start_index: To store the starting index of the longest valid subsequence.

2. Iterate Through the List:

Update the prefix_sum by adding the current stone's value.

Compute the remainder of prefix_sum when divided by 5.

If this remainder has been seen before, it indicates that the subsequence between the previous index (where this remainder was first seen) and the current index has a sum divisible by 5.

Calculate the length of this subsequence and update max_length and start_index if this subsequence is longer than previously found ones.

If the remainder hasn't been seen before, store the current index in remainder_index_map.

3. Extract the Longest Subsequence:

After processing all stones, if max_length is greater than 0, extract the subsequence starting from start_index with length max_length.

If no valid subsequence is found, return an empty list.
